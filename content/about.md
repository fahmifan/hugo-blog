I'm Muhammad Fahmi Irfananda and I'm 20 year old undergraduate student of Computer Science in Padjadjaran University. 

I have been pursuing the applications development for the past year in and out of lectures. So, I'm very familiar with it. You can check my projects [here](https://miun173.github.io/projects/)

I'm currently a member of lab teaching assitant at my university, also an active member of Developer Community at my Hima (Himpunan Mahasiswa).

Please email me to talk more :)
