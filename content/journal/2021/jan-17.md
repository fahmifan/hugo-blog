- TIL about API Economy, developer used to know them as Devtools or SaaS
  - They are just an API, then why is it important ? 
  - So, I read about this from [The Light and Dark Side of the API Economy](https://www.swyx.io/api-economy/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)
  - "if we can't stay above the API, we will be below the API"
    - Above the API: utilize the power of API to make make economy
    - Below the API: our job could be replaced by the API, less power
  - API improve dev speed in early days, use Stripe for payment, Sendgrid to sent email, Twillio to sent messages, Cloudinary for image upload & manipulation
    - Built from grounds means time to develop, maintenance cost, and no SLA guarantee
  - But, at big a scale, need a pricing adjustment, in house built also an option
  - GUI Economy: API + No-Code
    - No-Code reduce technical knowledge to develop a product
    - Some SaaS combine No-Code with some customization of APIs
      - e.g. Retool, Mailgun email template
