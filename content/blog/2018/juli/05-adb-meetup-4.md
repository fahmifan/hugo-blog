So last night i attend my first Android Developer Meetup in Bandung from ADB that held in Dicoding Space. The topics are about "A/B Testing Using Firebase Remote Config" & "Make a Android Starterkit using Yeoman Generator".

## A/B Testing Using Firebase Remote Config
In this first talk they told us what is A/B testing, how to do it, and the technical part on do A/B testing using the Firebase Remote Config.

### What is A/B Testing
A/B Testing is used when you want to know what design that works for your users.  It can be different design of button, checkout page, color scheme, fonts, ect. 

### How to do A/B Testing
First, you need to set your goal. What do you want to get from this testing. 

Let's say you have an online news/magzine. Your users can read a part of your article, but to read the full article they need to `sign in/up`. So you want to increase the `sign in/up` rates from this.

Now you make a hypothesis, the user will sign in if i make the button in capsule instead of rectangle shape.  

Then you make two version of it and send the new version you want to test to your sample users.

Then after you collect the data about your test. You can decide now, if the change on the button affect the `sign in/up` rates to your app.
