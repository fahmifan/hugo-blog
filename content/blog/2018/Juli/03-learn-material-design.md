I have a project with my friends for MTQMN DAQ. It's an android app with a feature kind of to detect your recitation. It's still WIP and i worked on the android development, while my friends work on Machine Learning and as a project manager. This project is challenging, because i am new to android development and trying to make a good decision about architecture and design is not easy. I need to read more about design pattern, RxJava2, and material design. I hope i can make it on time and qualified to the final round :). 

I'd like to post my journey of making this apps in future posts. Well, my english is not that good, so i might use Bahasa Indonesia if it's too difficullt for me to explain it in english. Hahaha!
