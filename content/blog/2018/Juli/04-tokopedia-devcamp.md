So, today i just did my online test for Tokopedia Devcamp 2018. This is my second time do online test, and it not that bad. Before, i was always feeling that i woludn't survive on algorithmic test type. The reason for this is because when i take algorithm class in my first year, i did not that good. Sometimes i get overwhelmed to solve a pyramid stars.

> _"At least I've been trying hard"_

That was my motivation to prepared for this online test and keep trying to solve excercises. Just **try it** and feel the struggle, but when you solve it you will get that eureka moment. Even if i can't solve it, _at least i've been trying hard_.
I hope this test get a good  result, and i can go for interview.

If you want to try or learn algorithm/competitive programming try these

* [Hackerrank](http://hackerrank.com/)
* [Codility](https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/)

I used codility to excercise since the online test use codility. 

Thank you :D
