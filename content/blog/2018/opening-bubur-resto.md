My family just open a bubur resto. The taste is delicious, really :D. It located in Ahmad Yani Street No.909, Bandung. This is what it looks like:

It was openning in my college break, i was helping opening it, even tho i can't serve the `bubur` for a customer `XD`, so i just delivered the bubur to customer when it ready.

It's fun!
