For the last week I do sprint for making a food app. When i go to college, sometimes i have to stay overnight in my friends house. Doing homework make us hungry and when we want to order food we don't have the menus and it was annoying so i want to make a webapp to display a menus of small restaurants there. It build using ReactJs, tachyons, & styled-components for frontend & lumen for backend api. It's still in development but the core feature is done, it left the login and adding reviews for a restaurant features. This is my first project outside the college tasks and i have a lot of trouble and fun. Still progress to finishing all features and then deploy it to the web.
