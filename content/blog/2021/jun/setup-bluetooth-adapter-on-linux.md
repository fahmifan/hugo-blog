I have a desktop and would like to add bluetooth adapter for it. So i bought 
this "ORICO BTA508 USB Bluetooth 5.0 Dongle BTA 508 BTA-508 Adapter - Hitam" from [Tokopedia](https://www.tokopedia.com/clickandgo/orico-bta508-usb-bluetooth-5-0-dongle-bta-508-bta-508-adapter-hitam). The only official driver/firmware for it is Windows. 
So, how about linux ? We need to know which chip, the bluetooth uses. Use this command to check it `dmesg |grep -i Bluetooth`
The output should looks like this
```
[    1.810236] usb 1-4.2: Product: Bluetooth Radio
...
[    3.546498] Bluetooth: hci0: RTL: loading rtl_bt/rtl8761b_fw.bin
[    3.551034] Bluetooth: hci0: RTL: loading rtl_bt/rtl8761b_config.bin
...
```

This line `hci0: RTL: loading rtl_bt/rtl8761b_fw.bin` shows us that the chip is `rtl8761b` and it need `rtl8761b_fw` firmware.
So i google `rtl8761b_fw` and found an article from [raspberry forum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=294634) about the same question.
But, i look up it once again and found this arcg linux [post](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rtl8761b-fw/). Then i download the [sources](https://mpow.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mpow_BH519A_driver+for+Linux.7z) and follow the steps from the raspberry forum article. 

1. Extract the driver
2. Copy the drivers
```
sudo cp -iv 20201202_LINUX_BT_DRIVER/rtkbt-firmware/lib/firmware/rtlbt/rtl8761b_fw /lib/firmware/rtl_bt/rtl8761b_fw.bin

sudo cp -iv 20201202_LINUX_BT_DRIVER/rtkbt-firmware/lib/firmware/rtlbt/rtl8761b_config /lib/firmware/rtl_bt/rtl8761b_config.bin
```
3. Reboot

Thats it, it works for my machine
```
