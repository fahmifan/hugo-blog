Like eating, consuming informations should have a portion.
We have limited appetiet, too much eating results into sick stomach, stress.
Fear of Missing Out or FOMO, is a kind of anxity that comes from "too much information".

Internet might be the source of this. Why ? Open internet, bring massive, free, and
accessible information into socity. Social media, a decendant of internet known as "rich" in information, such as Twitter, Instagram, Tiktok, Youtube. Game, richer than those socmeds combine audio, visual, story telling and interactivity.

> So, what is the root that cause this "Information Overflow" ?

Is it our behaviour that keep staring at our screen ? Is it the context switching? Socmed has many different context between it tweets. Is it creates low quality in absorbing information ? Is it creating the FOMO ? Do we actually have this "quality" ?

My hunch is yes. Actullay, i barely remember the tweets that i have read. When i found an interesting articel/tweet i save it into "getpocket" app. But, its unlikely that i'll visit them in getpocket. This might be the result of FOMO.

In Software Engineering, there is a phrase You Aren't Gonna Need It or Yagni. It means, you rarely need something that beyond scope. Now, how to identify if something categorized as Yagni ? If it less or insignificant, leave it, put it into Yagni. I think, information around internet is the same, the level of significant will weigh them to falls into Yagni or not.

But, how to make the information a Yagni or not for us, if we have not read or saw it ? I don't know yet. May be, we can hide them behind a software. It is like someone hand picked information for us in digestable size.
